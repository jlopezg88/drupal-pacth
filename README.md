Hi, I've been testing the the patch against the branch 8.3.x and for me it works fine. I followed the steps below:

<li>I created a new field for the Article content type.</li>
<li>At the second step I was able to see the "previous" buttton.</li>
<li>Clicking on the previous button I was redirected to the previous step successfully.</li>
<li>Editing the values and moving back again, works as well.</li>
<li>The button doesn't appear if we edit the field once that we created it.</li>
