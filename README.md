Hi, I've been testing the the patch against the branch 8.3.x and for me it works fine. I followed the steps below:

I created a new field for the Article content type.
At the second step I was able to see the "previous" buttton.
Clicking on the previous button I was redirected to the previous step successfully.
Editing the values and moving back again, works as well.
The button doesn't appear if we edit the field once that we created it.
